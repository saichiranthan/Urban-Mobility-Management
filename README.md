## Overview
The Urban Mobility Management project focuses on exploring various machine learning techniques and algorithms to address challenges in urban transportation. The project encompasses three main components:

1. **Linear Regression Model**: Predicting average travel times during normal and peak hours using linear regression.

2. **YOLO Model**: Utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to predict traffic density and use it to detemine heuristics.

3. **Route Optimization Algorithm**: Implementing the A* search algorithm to find the most optimized route based on various factors such as traffic density, travel time, and distance.

## Features
- Predicting travel times using  regression models
- Detecting vehicles and calculating traffic density with YOLO
- Finding optimal routes using the A* search algorithm
- Considering multiple factors like travel time, traffic density, and distance in route optimization
